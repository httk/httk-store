# Data management

*httk-store* is the **data-management capability layer** of *httk₂*. httk-core
defines the neutral `httk.core.EntryProvider` contract, the OPTIMADE
property/entry-type definition model, and the stdlib-only record dataclasses
(`Reference`, `File`, `Calculation`) — but ships no concrete providers and no
third-party dependencies. httk-store provides capabilities built on those
models:

- **entry providers** that serve the record models through the provider
  contract,
- **property-definition validation** on `jsonschema`, and
- the **database storage layer** `httk.store.backend.sql` (see {doc}`db`), which stores
  plain frozen dataclasses relationally and serves them through the same
  provider contract.

## Entry providers

`ReferenceEntryProvider`, `FileEntryProvider`, and `CalculationEntryProvider`
map a `{id: record}` mapping — where each record is a httk-core dataclass (or a
plain mapping coerced into one) — onto the neutral contract. A provider answers
three questions: which entry types it serves (each described by a first-class
`httk.core.EntryTypeDefinition`), which record key holds each served property
(`property_keys()`), and what the records are (`records()`, plain JSON-able
mappings). Two optional hooks add relationships: `relationships()` maps an entry
id to related entries, and `reverse_relationships()` declares the derived reverse
of edges another type owns.

```python
from httk.core import Reference
from httk.store import ReferenceEntryProvider

provider = ReferenceEntryProvider(
    {
        "ref-1": Reference(title="A study of gallium titanium compounds", doi="10.1234/demo.2021.1"),
        "ref-2": {"title": "Silicon dioxide polymorphs revisited", "year": "2019"},
    }
)

# The served entry type is the vendored OPTIMADE 'references' definition:
entry_types = provider.entry_types()
assert list(entry_types) == ["references"]
assert entry_types["references"].properties["title"].optimade_type == "string"

# property_keys() maps served property name -> record key; records() are JSON-able:
property_keys = provider.property_keys("references")
assert property_keys["id"] == "__id" and property_keys["type"] == "type"

records = list(provider.records("references"))
assert {r["__id"] for r in records} == {"ref-1", "ref-2"}
assert records[0]["type"] == "references"
```

### Discovery through the registry

The three providers self-register when `httk.core` discovers the module, under
the names `store-references`, `store-files`, and `store-calculations` (the
database-backed provider of {doc}`db` registers alongside them as
`store-db-store`). A serving module (such as *httk-serve*) can therefore
find them through the registry without importing httk-store directly:

```python
import httk.core
from httk.core.register import known_entry_providers
from httk.core._plugins import resolve_callable
from httk.core.register import entry_providers

registered = set(known_entry_providers())
assert {"store-references", "store-files", "store-calculations"} <= registered

# The registered value is a lazy factory reference; resolve and instantiate it:
factory = resolve_callable(entry_providers.require("store-references").handler)
provider = factory({"ref-1": {"title": "A study"}})
assert list(provider.entry_types()) == ["references"]
```

To actually serve these providers over HTTP as an OPTIMADE API, hand them to
*httk-serve*'s `adapter_from_providers` (see that module's documentation).
*httk-store* does not depend on *httk-serve*: the provider handoff uses the
httk-core contract, while *httk-serve* also consumes *httk-store*'s neutral
query and store APIs.

## Validation

`validate_property` checks a single value against one property definition, and
`validate_record` checks a whole record against an entry-type definition. Both
build a `jsonschema` **Draft 2020-12** validator directly from the definition's
OPTIMADE document. The definitions are self-contained (no `$ref`), and the
document's `$schema` *meta*-schema reference is removed before validation, so
**no network access or schema resolution ever happens** — validation is fully
offline.

```python
from httk.core import standard_entry_type
from httk.store import validate_property, validate_record

references = standard_entry_type("references")

# A single value against one property definition (references.year is a string):
validate_property(references.properties["year"], "2021")

# Nullable properties accept None:
assert references.properties["year"].nullable
validate_property(references.properties["year"], None)

# A whole record against the entry-type definition. Properties absent from the
# record are simply not checked (serving a subset is normal); 'id' and 'type'
# must be present:
validate_record(
    references,
    {"id": "ref-1", "type": "references", "title": "A study", "year": "2021"},
)
```

### Failing validation

A value that does not match its definition raises `PropertyValidationError`
(a `ValueError`). The underlying `jsonschema` error is kept as the chained
cause:

```python
from httk.core import standard_entry_type
from httk.store import PropertyValidationError, validate_property, validate_record

references = standard_entry_type("references")

# 'year' is a string property, so an integer is rejected:
try:
    validate_property(references.properties["year"], 2021)
except PropertyValidationError as exc:
    assert exc.name == "year"
    assert exc.__cause__ is not None  # the jsonschema ValidationError

# Unknown property names are rejected, naming them and the entry type:
try:
    validate_record(references, {"id": "r", "type": "references", "sprocket": 3})
except PropertyValidationError as exc:
    assert "sprocket" in str(exc)

# 'id' and 'type' are required:
try:
    validate_record(references, {"type": "references"})
except PropertyValidationError as exc:
    assert exc.name == "id"
```

## Backend-backed serving

The entry providers above are in-memory. To store records in a database and
serve them the same way, see {doc}`db`: `httk.store.backend.sql.SqlStore` stores plain
frozen dataclasses in SQLite, DuckDB, or PostgreSQL, and `StoreEntryProvider`
(registered as `store-db-store`) serves them through the identical provider
contract — including the provenance relationships a run's `StrongLink` edges
emit in both directions.
