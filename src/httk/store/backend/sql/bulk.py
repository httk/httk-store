"""Bulk ingestion for :class:`~httk.store.backend.sql.store.SqlStore`.

:class:`BulkIngest` is the context manager returned by
:meth:`~httk.store.backend.sql.store.SqlStore.bulk_ingest`. It replaces the per-record
``save()`` loop: instead of one statement round-trip per row with an
in-database deduplication protocol, it encodes each object with the pure
encoders in :mod:`httk.store.backend.sql.store` (``_encode_parent_row`` and
``_encode_child_rows``), assigns sids from monotonic in-memory counters,
deduplicates set-wise, and appends buffered rows into the record tables with
executemany batches inside one transaction.

Two modes share the same encoder:

- *Empty store* (a fresh build): tables absent from the database are created
  without their separable indexes, buffered rows are appended directly, and the
  indexes (content-id uniqueness, ``ix_``/``uq_``, composite, child parent-sid)
  are built only once the stream has loaded — their creation is itself the
  uniqueness verification.
- *Populated store* (incremental append): tables that already hold rows keep
  their sid allocation above the current maximum. Each flushed chunk is staged
  into an ordinary ``bulkstage_<table>`` table and resolved set-wise against the
  target — a content-id anti-join (with in-memory
  :class:`~httk.core.storage.markers.IdentitySkip` metadata verification of the
  hits, reproducing :meth:`~httk.store.backend.sql.store.SqlStore.save`), a ``by_value``
  whole-parent-column anti-join with null-safe equality, and a sid remap that
  rewrites every still-buffered reference to a deduplicated existing sid before
  it is flushed. The ``index_strategy`` knob chooses whether existing tables
  keep their indexes during the append or rebuild them at the end.

Deduplication mirrors :meth:`~httk.store.backend.sql.store.SqlStore.save` set-wise: a
``"content_id"`` table keeps a ``content_id -> sid`` map (a hit returns the
mapped sid and buffers neither the parent row nor its children, and — unless
``verify_metadata`` is disabled — compares
:class:`~httk.core.storage.markers.IdentitySkip` metadata against the first
occurrence in memory, or against the stored row for a hit against existing data,
raising :class:`~httk.store.store_common.EntryMetadataConflictError`); a
``"by_value"`` table keeps a whole-parent-column-tuple map (a hit returns the
mapped sid with no metadata check); a ``"none"`` table always inserts.
Multi-record entry families buffer one deduplicated dispatch row per content id,
raising :class:`~httk.store.store_common.EntryDispatchIntegrityError` on a
conflicting backing.

A third, opt-in mode parallelizes the encode. ``bulk_ingest(workers=N)`` with
``N > 1`` forks a pool of worker processes (the ``fork`` start method, so each
inherits the unpicklable store and never touches its database) and pickles each
saved object onto a shared task queue. Every worker runs the *same* pure
encoders against a per-worker :class:`~httk.store.store_common.SaveProjection`,
allocating sids from a disjoint block and writing per-table shard files
(pyarrow Parquet on DuckDB — the optional ``parallel`` extra — or a native
SQLite database per worker). The main process then merges the shards inside the
ingest's spanning transaction: it loads every shard under the block sids,
collapses cross-worker duplicates set-wise (content-id and by_value), verifies
each surviving collision's identity-excluded metadata with a grouped scan,
sweeps rows orphaned by a collapsed duplicate's subtree, and renumbers the
survivors to a compact range.
Parallel mode targets the offline *build* of a store and requires a physically
empty target; incremental appends into a populated store stay on the serial
path. The implementation lives in :mod:`httk.store.backend.sql.bulk_parallel`; see its
module docstring for the full contract. On a fresh supported store, serial
``finalize="auto"`` selects the deferred finalizer; parallel ``auto`` remains
on the parity merge.

Identity caches are not populated by bulk ingestion (documented best-effort);
they are cleared on failure.

Two behaviors diverge from the per-record ``save()`` loop:

- *Returned sids are provisional until the context exits.* A record that
  deduplicates against a row the store already held is remapped to that existing
  sid at flush, so the sid :meth:`BulkIngest.save` returned is not durable for
  such a record. :meth:`BulkIngest.resolved_sid`, given the stored record type
  and a returned sid, maps it to its final stored sid once the context has
  exited cleanly.
- *Nested metadata-conflict messages carry the descendant's path.* Because the
  bulk encoder resolves referenced and child records eagerly and only discovers
  their existing-row hits at flush, an :class:`~httk.core.storage.markers.IdentitySkip`
  conflict reached through a ``descend`` field (a non-skipped reference whose
  target itself carries skipped metadata) is reported against the descendant
  record (at its own path, e.g. ``"Leaf.note"``) rather than the ancestor field
  path save() would use (e.g. ``"Root.primary.note"``). The exception type and
  abort-and-roll-back behavior are identical; the conflict message differs in
  its path prefix and, for some nested ``None``/length mismatches, in its
  detail text.
- *DuckDB never drops an existing table's indexes.* DuckDB reserves a dropped
  index's name until commit, so an in-transaction drop-then-recreate of the same
  index is rejected. Under ``index_strategy="rebuild"`` (or an ``"auto"`` rebuild
  decision) DuckDB therefore keeps the indexes in place through the append —
  relying on their incremental maintenance — and verifies content-id uniqueness
  with a duplicate-scan at finalize instead of an index rebuild. SQLite drops the
  separable indexes up front and recreates them at the end, where the creation is
  itself the uniqueness verification. Both leave the same final indexes present.
