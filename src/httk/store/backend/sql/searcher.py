"""The query DSL: build and run searches over stored dataclasses through SQLAlchemy Core.

:class:`SqlSearcher` (obtained from :meth:`~httk.store.backend.sql.store.SqlStore.searcher`)
implements the backend-agnostic search protocols of :mod:`httk.store.query` —
:class:`~httk.store.query.Searcher`, :class:`~httk.store.query.SearchVariable`,
:class:`~httk.store.query.SearchField`, :class:`~httk.store.query.SearchExpression`
— porting the query semantics of the v1 ``httk.db`` ``FilteredCollection``
searchers onto SQLAlchemy Core:

- :meth:`SqlSearcher.variable` binds a storable class to a **fresh alias** of
  its table; two variables of the same class therefore make a self-join.
- Attribute access on a :class:`SqlVariable` follows the class's resolved
  :class:`~httk.store.backend.schema.TableSchema`: scalar and encoded fields yield a
  :class:`SqlColumn` over the field's query column; reference fields yield a
  chainable :class:`SqlReference` that compares by foreign key
  (``v.ref == other_variable`` / ``== stored_object`` / ``== None``) and, on
  further attribute access, lazily LEFT OUTER JOINs a fresh alias of the target
  table (``v.ref.doi`` chains arbitrarily deep; one join alias per reference
  path per variable); variable-length (child-table) fields LEFT OUTER JOIN the
  child table (a fresh alias per attribute access, so independent set
  predicates on one field — e.g. ``v.symbols.has_any('O') &
  v.symbols.has_any('Ca')`` — constrain independent joined rows, as in httk
  v1) and switch the searcher into grouped mode (GROUP BY the root rows).
- Comparisons and set operations on columns produce :class:`SqlExpression`
  objects carrying **two** renderings — a WHERE-position clause and a
  HAVING-position clause — exactly as the v1 searcher rendered one expression
  per position. Each expression also carries **its own placement**, so
  :meth:`SqlSearcher.add` is the only way to apply one: the WHERE rendering
  always applies, and the HAVING rendering additionally applies when the
  expression is flagged :attr:`SqlExpression.post` (the for-all forms
  ``has_only`` and child-field ``is_in``, and any ``~`` over a set-derived
  subtree — see :class:`SqlExpression`'s ``__invert__``, which lets ``~``
  express "no joined row matches").
  Alongside the two renderings each expression carries the **non-aggregated
  columns its HAVING rendering references** (:attr:`SqlExpression.group_columns`), unioned
  by ``&``/``|`` and preserved by ``~``. A grouped query GROUP BYs those
  columns in addition to the root ``sid``\\ s (``SqlSearcher._grouping``, which
  both ``count()`` and iteration go through): a plain comparison reaching HAVING
  position mentions a root-table column directly, and strict dialects (DuckDB)
  reject such a column unless it is grouped, while permissive ones (SQLite)
  accept it via functional dependency on the grouped primary key. Grouping by
  it is sound for exactly that reason — one distinct value per group — and the
  same applies to the sort keys, which the same helper adds.

The neutral protocol's string matching is ``contains``/``startswith``/
``endswith`` over **literal** text; this backend renders them as SQL LIKE with
backslash as the escape character, escaping ``%`` and ``_`` in the given text
first. The LIKE rendering itself is private (``SqlColumn._like``) precisely
because pattern syntax is a dialect detail that must not leak into the
contract.

Encoded (codec) fields compare against their query column: for rationals that
is the float companion column, so SQL comparisons on them are documented
float-approximate (stored values themselves round-trip exactly). Comparison
values are encoded through the field's codec, e.g. comparing a
:class:`fractions.Fraction` field against ``Fraction(1, 3)`` compares the
float column against ``float(Fraction(1, 3))``.

Set-operation semantics (ported from the v1 ``BinaryBooleanOp._sql``,
translated to portable SQLAlchemy aggregates): in WHERE position ``has_any``
renders as ``column IN values`` while ``has_only`` renders as constant true; in
HAVING position the aggregate forms
``SUM(CASE WHEN column [NOT] IN values THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)``
compare per-group match counts. A NULL child value — the LEFT OUTER JOIN row
of a parent with no children — never satisfies ``IN`` (nor ``NOT IN``), so a
record with an empty child list matches ``has_only`` and fails ``has_any``,
the exact set semantics of the reference in-memory store.
