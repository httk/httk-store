# Searching and exact values

The examples use the `StructureRecord` class and `store` from
[Declaring, storing, and fetching records](db-records.md).

## Searching

`store.searcher()` opens a query through the backend-agnostic protocols in
`httk.store.query`: bind classes to variables and add conditions. Freeze the
query into the user-facing lazy result set with `results()`. Variables of the
same class self-join; reference fields chain (`v.reference.name`),
variable-length fields support the set operations (`has_any`, `has_only`), and
`~` negates them as sets. String matching (`contains`, `startswith`,
`endswith`) always takes **literal** text — `%` and `_` match themselves:

```python
search = store.searcher()
s = search.variable(StructureRecord)
search.add(s.spacegroup == 225)
search.add(s.reference.name == "Ada")  # auto-joins the author table
search.add(s.symbols.has_only("O", "Ca", "Ti"))  # for-all over the child rows
search.add(~s.symbols.has_any("Fe"))  # no child row is iron
results = search.results(structure=s, energy=s.energy)
for row in results:  # lazy ResultRow values
    print(row.structure.formula, row.energy)  # exact rational energy
```

`ResultRow` supports names, attributes, and positions. `scalars()` is the
short form for a one-column result (or takes a column name), and `first()` and
`one()` return one row; `one()` raises `NoResultError` or
`MultipleResultsError` unless there is exactly one. Results are reusable:
`len(results)`, `results[1:3]`, and re-iteration are all supported. A slice is
a view over its own positions: iteration, `len()`, indexing, `first()`,
`one()`, and `column()` are all scoped to that slice without re-querying.

Scalar columns stay exact by default. `column()` returns a `ResultColumn` with
an explicit approximate view through `.floats()` and an exact rational tensor
through `.to_fracvector()` for integer, fraction, and fracscalar columns:

```python
energies = results.column("energy")
exact = list(energies)
approximate = list(energies.floats())
as_vector = energies.to_fracvector()
```

`.to_fracvector()` rejects floats, surds, strings, datetimes, and other
non-rational projections. Variable-length CHILD-role projections are rejected
when `results()` is declared; reference-path projections are supported.

### Pandas-style slicer indexing

`search.slicer(cls)` wraps this same DSL in a `[]` indexing surface that reads
like pandas. It is pure sugar — it compiles bracket indexing into the
`variable`/`add`/`output`/`results` calls above and adds no query capability of
its own:

```python
note = store.searcher().slicer(StructureRecord)
list(note["formula"])                        # one field's decoded values
list(note[note["energy"] < 0])               # records a boolean mask selects
len(note[note["spacegroup"] == 225])         # count of a selection
```

A field-name string gives a **column** (iterate for values); comparisons and
the helpers `isin`, `isna`, `notna`, `between`, and the literal
`.str.contains`/`startswith`/`endswith` build a boolean **mask**; indexing with
a mask gives a **selection** (iterate for reconstructed records, or take its
`len()`). Masks combine with `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`, where both operands must be
masks of the same slicer. Every operation runs against a *fresh* searcher, so a
filtered selection never leaks its condition into the next operation, and
iterating the slicer itself yields every record.

The slicer never sorts (some conforming stores reject ordering) and offers no
`.loc`/`.iloc`, integer/slice indexing, or multi-column selection — use the
plain searcher for those. The same `slicer(cls)` method is available on the
Mongo and federated searchers.

### Continuation pages

`SqlResultSet.page()` is an optional capability (described neutrally by
`httk.store.PageableResultSetLike`), separate from the required `ResultSetLike`
contract. It uses a stable keyset/seek order over named **root scalar result
projections** and returns an immutable `ResultPage`:

```python
from httk.store import PageOrder

page = results.page(
    size=100,
    order_by=(PageOrder("spacegroup"), PageOrder("energy", descending=True)),
)
for row in page.rows:
    print(row.structure.formula, row.energy)

if page.next is not None:
    later = results.page(
        size=100,
        order_by=(PageOrder("spacegroup"), PageOrder("energy", descending=True)),
        cursor=page.next,
    )
```

`PageOrder.name` refers to the output name (`"energy"` above), not a
SQLAlchemy column. Ordering accepts root scalar and encoded-scalar projections;
object outputs, child/reference-derived keys, duplicate names, an existing
`add_sort()`, a nonzero query offset, and a query limit are rejected. The SQL
implementation always appends the root `sid` as an internal ascending
tie-breaker, so duplicate user-order values do not duplicate or skip rows.
`nulls="first"`/`"last"` is explicit and portable across SQLite and DuckDB.
An empty order tuple is valid when storage order by root `sid` is sufficient.

The opaque URL-safe `ContinuationToken` contains only a version, tagged anchor
values, root sid, direction, and a digest binding the frozen query/output/order
schema and dialect. It contains no SQL and decoded values are always bound
parameters. It is deliberately not authenticated: a web boundary can wrap its
string value in an HMAC or another authenticated envelope. Corrupt, oversized,
non-canonical, or mismatched tokens raise `PaginationCursorError`; do not
construct application tokens yourself.

Pages are **live**: every call uses a fresh read connection and does not keep a
driver cursor or transaction open. On an unchanged store, following `next` and
then `previous` recovers the original page. Concurrent direct database changes
can move, insert, or remove matches between calls, so continuation paging does
not promise snapshot consistency.

A page fetches at most `size + 1` root match rows and uses a lexicographic seek
predicate rather than a query offset; the library hard-caps `size` at 10,000.
`include_total=False` (the default) does not count. `include_total=True` runs
the normal exact SQL count separately. This bounds application memory and match
row transfer, not database CPU for arbitrary filters or sorts; indexed root
order fields benefit from the indexes declared in the schema.

`cursor()` bounds the number of hydrated record/proxy objects held by a
row-by-row consumer, but not the raw values pinned by the result set. The
object value in each cursor `ResultRow` is an instance of the record class, so
views can be built on it. Each object output uses an explicitly unhashable,
reused proxy that expires when the cursor advances. Equality on an expired
cursor row raises; copying and pickling cursor rows are rejected even before
expiry. Components already filled into a view before advancing remain
readable on that view, but later component fills raise
`ExpiredCursorRowError`.

### Low-level portable protocol

The backend-neutral protocol form remains useful for code that must run on
any `Searcher` implementation. Declare outputs and iterate its plain
`SearchResult` values directly:

```python
search.output(s, "structure")
for (structure,), names in search:
    print(names, structure.formula)
```

This is the low-level/portable layer; SQL consumers should generally use
`results()`.

### Neutral portable Store profile

`httk.store.Store` is intentionally a small, backend-neutral contract:
`store.searcher()` returns a one-query `Searcher`, which binds one or more
backend-defined targets with `variable()`, receives expressions through
`add()`, and exposes `count()`, limit/offset, sorting, iteration, and
`results()`. A portable result supports iteration, `len()`, `first()`, `one()`,
and `scalars()`; `one()` uses the shared `NoResultError` and
`MultipleResultsError` exceptions. `UnsupportedQueryError` means that a
requested expression is outside a particular backend's portable subset.

This profile is deliberately what a remote, read-only OPTIMADE store can
implement too: it supports a single root endpoint, portable scalar/flat-list
filters, named outputs, and result cardinality without making the caller
depend on SQLAlchemy or a database dialect. Query code that only needs this
profile should depend on `httk.store.Store`, not `SqlStore`.

The following are SQL-specific extensions, not portable Store requirements:
persisting/fetching frozen dataclasses with `save()` and `fetch()`, schema and
transaction management, recursive reference storage, lazy SQL rows,
`ResultColumn.floats()`/`to_fracvector()`, cursor rows, child/reference joins,
continuation pages, and SQL's approximate comparisons for exact rationals. Do not assume those
operations exist on a remote or in-memory Store.

A plain comparison on a child field is existential un-negated and set-negating
under `~`: `s.symbols == "O"` means "some symbol is O", `~(s.symbols == "O")`
means "no symbol is O" (not "some symbol is not O"), agreeing with
`~s.symbols.has_any("O")`. `is_in` reads by field kind: on a root field
`s.formula.is_in("CaTiO3", "NaCl")` is plain membership, while on a child field
`s.symbols.is_in("O", "Ca", "Ti")` is the for-all reading — every element must
be in the set — exactly the same as `has_only`.

`s.always_true()` and `s.always_false()` are constant conditions on a search
variable. They are reserved method names that never resolve to a stored field,
and they matter mainly to code that builds filters programmatically: the
obvious alternative, a `field == field` probe, is not NULL-safe — it yields
NULL rather than true for a row whose field is NULL, and so silently drops
rows.

### Result and identity semantics

Search rows are lazy subclasses of the storable class, so `isinstance(row,
StructureRecord)` is true. The parent row is loaded when the row is first
used, and fields decode independently as they are accessed. They provide the
dataclass-generated compare/hash/repr behavior, honoring each field's
`compare`, `hash`, and `repr` flags, plus the same content-id and `save()`
behavior as the eager record. Classes with custom `__eq__` or `__hash__` are
rejected for lazy rows. Each row also exposes its database `sid`.

`dataclasses.replace(row, ...)` creates a new ordinary dataclass instance of
the lazy row class and runs validation. Lazy rows intentionally reject
`copy.copy`, `copy.deepcopy`, and pickling. Search rows bypass the store's
identity cache: two result rows for one sid are not an identity guarantee.
`fetch()` returns lazy rows too (see [Lazy records](db-records.md#lazy-records)); repeated
default fetches of one live sid return the same object.

An object output from an outer join can be `None`; the result row is retained,
not dropped. If a matched sid is deleted before an object output's lazy row is
hydrated, hydration raises `StaleResultError`; exact scalar projections cannot
become stale because their values and `_exact` companion texts came from the
outer SELECT.

### Memory and statement cost

The result set materializes a match index that pins the matched sids, raw
scalar-output values, and, for exact projections, their `_exact` companion
texts. All of those arrive in the one outer SELECT; there is no second
per-chunk exact-value fetch. Hydrated records live in a weak chunk cache of
500 parent sids; live rows pin their own chunk, while re-iteration may
rehydrate chunks that are no longer pinned. `cursor()` limits hydrated
record/proxy objects, not this pinned raw result data. A typical full-object
pass costs one outer match query plus about one parent query per 500 rows and
one batch per touched child-field group per 500 rows — not one SELECT per row.
The public store API is append-only, so rows do not disappear during normal
use; direct database edits can produce `StaleResultError` for object outputs.

## Exact rationals, approximate comparisons

Rational values (`fractions.Fraction`, `FracScalar`, `SurdScalar`,
`FracVector` tensors) are stored **losslessly**: a canonical exact text column
is the round-trip source of truth, alongside float companion columns used for
querying and indexing. Stored values therefore reconstruct exactly at
arbitrary precision — but SQL comparisons (and sorting) on rational fields run
on the float companions and are **documented approximate**. Content identity
and deduplication always use the exact form.
